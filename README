NetduinoMQTT

Introduction:

This is a simple, incomplete, MQTT (MQTT.org) message publisher.  

It can be used by the Netduino to send MQTT messages to a MQTT broker.

This program is intended to be VERY readable - even at the expense of size/performance.

Version 0.01(a) supports:

1.  Connecting to an MQTT broker (RSMB and mosquitto have been tested) (Section 3.1)
2.  Sending MQTT messages to a broker (Section 3.3)
3.  Disconnecting from a broker (Section 3.14) 
4.  Pings (used for keep alive - example in program.cs)

Version 0.01 will not be further enhanced (beyond bug fixes and maintaining protocol support at this basic level of functionality).  I think it is important to keep a publish only version without the QoS or Subscribe stuff.  I think this is important both for understanding the basics and for a very small client.

Version 0.02 (in progress) will support QoS 0 subscription functions.
Version 0.03 will support QoS > 0 (maybe)

So, yes, it is not a complete client at this time.  But as a "publisher", it supports useful features like authentication and full allowed length parameters (topic, message, username, password, etc).

I've talked with a couple people about subscription functionality and I see where this could be useful - maybe a "command" or "query" channel.  So, we'll add that, but I think to do this correctly will involve some big changes (any read can be a message instead of being known to be a response to publish commands).

None of this has been comprehensively tested.  If you do any testing - please let me know your results.  I did some very basic functional testing that seemed good and I'm planning on testing further when time allows.  But, if you use this - I'd love the feedback/assistance.

Thanks
