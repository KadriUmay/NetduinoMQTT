NetduinoMQTT

This is a simple, incomplete, MQTT message publisher.  

It started as a toy project for me to explore the Netduino Plus, but there was some interest, so I'm going to take this a bit farther then I had originally intended.

Given this, posting the source periodically as text in my blog didn't seem appropriate.

I have no experience with git and I think the last source code control system I used with any frequency was sccs on SunOS 4 - so, if I'm doing something wrong here - please let me know.
