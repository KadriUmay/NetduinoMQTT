NetduinoMQTT

Introduction:

This is a simple, incomplete, MQTT (MQTT.org) message publisher.  

It can be used by the Netduino to send MQTT messages to a MQTT broker.

This program is intended to be VERY readable - even at the expense of size/performance.

This supports:

1.  Connecting to an MQTT broker (RSMB and mosquitto have been tested) (Section 3.1)
2.  Sending MQTT messages to a broker (Section 3.3)
3.  Disconnecting from a broker (Section 3.14) 


This does not currently support:

1.  Anything to do with QoS > 0 
2.  Any subscription functionality
3.  "Will" functionality


So, yes, it is not a complete client at this time.  But as a "publisher", it supports useful features like authentication and full allowed length parameters (topic, message, username, password, etc).

It has not been comprehensively tested.  If you do any testing - please let me know your results.  I did some functional testing that seemed good and I'm planning on testing further when time allows.  But, if you use this - I'd love the feedback/assistance.

Thanks
Dan
